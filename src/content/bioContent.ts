export const aboutMeThree =
  "Although I'm often hard at work, my freetime is still very fulfilling. When I'm not at my desk, I'm practicing with my band, playing Magic or D&D with my friends, or wandering through nature. My favorite passtime, though, would have to be playing music. It doesn't matter what instrument; if you put it in front of me, I'll play it!";
